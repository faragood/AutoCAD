"Let's imagine that we have a plane xy. First, let's draw the outline of the figure by connecting the points, where the points are represented as a set of x and y coordinates: the point (0, 0) is connected to the point (40, 0); (40, 0) to (40, 10); (40, 10) to (35, 25); (35, 25) to (25, 25); (25, 25) to (25, 15), (25, 15) to (15, 15), (15, 15) to (15, 25), (15, 25) to (5, 25), (5, 25) to (0, 10), and (0, 10) to (0, 0). As a result, we have a closed outline. Now we need to extrude this closed path in the positive z direction by a distance of 40. Now we need to create the second shape: Let's create a path: (-10, 0) connected to the point (50, 0), (50, 0) to (50, 20), (50, 20) to (-10, 20), and (-10, 20) to (-10, 0). We have a closed path. Now extrude this path in the positive z direction by a distance of 10. We have a second shape. Now move the second shape by a distance of 15 in the positive z direction. Now we need to trim the shape: Let's create a path: (15, 15) connected to the point (25, 15), (25, 15) to (25, 25), (25, 25) to (15, 25), and (15, 25) to (15, 15). Now we need to cut both figures along this contour in the z direction of the positive coordinate at a distance of 40. This is the finished figure."
